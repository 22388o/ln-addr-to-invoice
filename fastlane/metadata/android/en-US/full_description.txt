Some popular Bitcoin Lightning wallets, like Muun, don't support email-like Lightning addresses. This app allows paying to such addresses by turning them to convenient invoices.
To use the app, click on the Lightning address link (like tip or zap in Nostr) and select "LN Address to Invoice" app. Follow the instructions and then pay the invoice with your favorite wallet. 
The app doesn't add any extra fee to your payment.
